This repo contains my solutions for the four projects that were part of Udacity's *Foundations in Artificial Intelligence* course as of early 2018. Udacity provides a starting point in the form of code with missing functionality and students write the missing functionality and add further features / research reports and so on. A good starting point is to look at the `.pdf` or `.html` report for each project - that should give  a good idea of what the student has done in the project.
